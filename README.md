## UX

#### User Stories

- *"As a User I go on a lot of sites and I am overloaded with information and pop-ups trying to sell me other things I did not come looking for. Can you make your site simple and easy to access?”*

- *"As a mobile-User sometimes I would like be able to go to the next page quicker by having the navigation accessible at all times”*

- *”As a mother and User, I would like to stay on this site while I check your social medias on another tab…”*

The site is predominantly a booking site for creative workshops:

* Feature 4 - Booking Form - This allows the user to easily book a date for their workshop and informs Papilion to contact them to finalise the contract

## __Technology Used__

I have listed the following languages and technology used to produce this project below:

* Markdown
    * For the ReadMe file
* HTML 5
    * For the base information and structure of the webpages
* CSS 3
    * For the styling and beauty of the webpages
* Materialize
    * Was used for navigation and sign-up form.


## Testing

Many attempts to start the project failed due to time, facilities and cognitive accumen.

1. I have tested all the links on the site and they lead to the correct pages.   
    I have also made sure that any which are linked to outside sites open in a new window.
